//input = array of building height & string direction = "EAST" || "WEST"
//if direction = EAST buildings are facing right in context of array
//if direction = WEST buildings are facing left in context of array
//a building can see sunset if it is higher than next building in its direction
// output returns indices of buildings that can see sunset in sorted order
//eg: [3,5,4,4,3,1,3,2] direction ="EAST"  output = [1,3,6,7]
//if direction = "WEST" output =[0,1]

//Time =O(n)
//space =O(n) - output to be stored and sorted
